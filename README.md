# React-Employee-Directory
To create an Employee Directory with Reactjs. By utilizing components, managing components states and responding to user events, we will separate the application's UI.

## Project Description

Company's Employee Directories can be very useful tools. Whether it be heavily relied on by new recruites, in the onboarding process, across departments, or for customer service purposes, having access to a databse that list all employees is a necessity. An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name. This application will implement Reactjs to do all the things listed herein, with the assistance of Random User API.

## User Story

* As a user, be able to view entire employee directory at once as to have quick access to employee information.

The user should be able to:

  * Sort the table by at least one category

  * Filter the users by at least one property.

## Demo Features:
